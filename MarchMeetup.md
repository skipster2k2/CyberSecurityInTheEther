# Cyber Security in the Ether March Meetup



We talked about:

## Homeworking, can we expect more businesses to make this permanent, and how do we protect against a threat landscape targeted at home workers?
* Most companies may find this a painful experience and write it off as a way of working.
* Countered by many people are enjoying working from home, will people pressure make it difficult to get them back in the office?
* Another benefit is that it has allowed the rollout of collaboration tools that weren't getting the political traction to implement before, and everyone is loving them.
* Some are feeling more connected to colleagues not less, talking to people remotely who I wouldnt do in the office.
* The risk of more malware infections is higher, with unmanaged devices and people clicking links seeking some well needed humour.
* Need to continue to remind people to remain vigilant but in a gentle way, everyone has a lot on their plate right now, the wrong messaging would be ignored.

## For someone starting out in the InfoSec field with a view to getting into Pentesting primarily, what certifications would you advise on?
* Comptia Security + and Network + were reccomended.
* Crest accreditied pen tester is a must have of Government work.
* There are lots of learning pathways on the [NCSC website](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/education-skills/professional-skills-training)
* Experience was generally viewed as more valuable than certs. Taking part in bug bounty programms is a good way to build up experience, but isn't very lucrative.
* A challenge can be not knowing what you don't know, and budget for training in small conpanies is a challenge. 

## Password manager guidance - how would this be most useful to people?
* How best to educate people in using password managers? Do people read documents?
* Is there anything wrong with using password managers in your browsers, rather than a 3rd party? Probably not these days.
* Again [NCSC guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/passwords/updating-your-approach) is good, do you need your own documentation? Point users at that instead?
* Find other ways of projecting the information, youtube videos for example.

## Changing corporate policy to enable simpler work from home.
* Look at what the consequences are of the policy not being followed, compromise on the lesser risks and re-plan mitigation for the bigger risks.
* In all work environments its worth asking, what does good look like? and then asking what does great look like? Work out how to get from good to great.
* Mobile Device Management software works well for distributed workers, but it may be a bit late to be rolling out if you haven't got it already.
* Virtual desktops are another good solution.
* There's a real challenge that many people dont have computers at home anymore, getting corporate laptops to homes is an asset management nightmare.
